# Simple Sleep and msleep

This isn't really impressive. I just wanted to have a simple package that just worked and did as I expected, so figured I'd do this and share it.


```javascript
const {sleep, msleep} = require('sleep-jml');

sleep(1); // sleeps for 1 second
msleep(1000); // sleeps for 1 second
```
